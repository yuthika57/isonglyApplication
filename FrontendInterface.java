     * This method takes a command entered by the user as input. It parses
     * that command to determine what kind of command it is, and then makes
     * use of the backend (which was passed to the constructor) to update the
     * state of that backend.  When a show or help command are issued, this
     * method prints the appropriate results to standard out.  When a command 
     * does not follow the syntax rules described above, this method should 
     * print out an error message that describes at least one defect in the 
     * syntax of the provided command argument.
     * 
     * Some notes on the expected behavior of the different commands:
     *     load: results in backend loading data from specified path
     *     year: updates backend's range of songs to return
     *                 should not result in any songs being displayed
     *     loudness: updates backend's filter threshold
     *                   should not result in any songs being displayed
     *     show: displays list of songs with currently set thresholds
     *           MAX_COUNT: argument limits the number of song titles displayed
     *           to the first MAX_COUNT in the list returned from backend
     *           most danceable: argument displays results returned from the
     *           backend's fiveMost method
     *     help: displays command instructions
     *     quit: ends this program (handled by runCommandLoop method above)
     *           (do NOT use System.exit(), as this will interfere with tests)
